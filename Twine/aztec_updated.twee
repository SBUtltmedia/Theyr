After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst your men has shifted. There is excitement about the riches that may well lie inland, but there is also a clear current of unease. You have heard whispers that the men have doubts about your leadership and that one of your crew may be even be planning a mutiny. <br>
<br>
You must convince your men to remain loyal. Only you can lead them to the gold and the glory that await them! You may want to address them as a group, but it might be more effective to win over each individually. Choose your best course of action and go to Discord to make your case.<br>
<br>
When you are satisfied with your effort [[you may continue on|Cortes Beaches Ships]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Olid">>
After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst the men has shifted. There is excitement about the riches that may well lie inland, but there is also a clear current of unease. You've always questioned Cortés' abilities and his betrayal of your friend Velazquez left a bitter taste in your mouth. Like Cortés, you are convinced that the journey inland could bring you untold riches, but you do not have faith in his leadership. Besides, whoever leads the expedition will surely be rewarded by the King. Now is your chance to take that victory for yourself!<br>
<br>
You must convince the others that you will make a better leader than Cortés. Go to Discord and convince them to mutiny. It is of the utmost importance that Cortés not find out, however, so be discrete in your interactions. You don't want to get caught!<br>

<<case "Alvarado" or "Aguilar" or "Garrido">>
After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst the crew has shifted. There is excitement about the riches that may well lie inland, but there is also a clear current of unease. Cortés thinks you should forge inland, in search of the Aztec capital and the riches that surely await you, but do you trust him to lead you there? There is at least one among you who lacks faith in Cortés.<br>
<br>
Go to Discord to see what is being said. Is Cortés able to maintain your support? Or can you be convinced to change your allegiance? You may be approached in private, so keep an eye on your DMs.<br>
<br>
Once you have decided where your loyalty lies, [[continue to the next screen|Mutiny Vote]].<br>

After your encounter with the Mexica, the mood amongst the men has shifted. There is excitement about the riches that may well lie inland, but there is also a clear current of unease. You have learned a great deal about your companions during these last weeks and it seems there is deep distrust among them.<br>
<br>
Go Discord to see what is being said. Will you support Cortés? Or would you rather place your trust in someone else? You may be approached in private, so keep an eye on your DMs. If the men do not yet perceive you as a member of the team, now might be a good time to prove your allegiance.<br>

November 18th, 1519.  Just off the shore of Cuba. <br>
<br>
You stand on the deck of the ship watching the city of Santiago de Cuba recede towards the horizon.  The wind has caught the sails, and the ship creaks as it begins to heel.  You can barely hear Velázquez yelling into the wind, yelling at Cortés to turn around and come back.

Velázquez is mad, and he hasn't yet discovered that, under Cortés' orders, you and the other men have raided the city's main storehouse, stealing all the provisions you hoped would last you through the uncertain adventures ahead.

You watch as Cortés cups his hands to his mouth, shouting back to the governor "Forgive me, Your Worship, for this and similar things have to be done rather than thought about!"

You cast your doubts aside, as Cortés assures you of the riches that undoubtedly lie ahead. [[Without risk, there can be no reward|Spaniards Quest Instructions 1]]!

You stand on the deck of the ship watching the city of Santiago de Cuba recede towards the horizon. The wind has caught the sails, and the ship creaks as it begins to heel. You can barely hear Velázquez yelling into the wind, yelling at you to turn around and come back.<br>

Welcome to the Spanish Aztec War! 
<<set $charCreated="true">>
You are part of the <<print $users[$userId]["faction"]>>

Let me tell you a bit about your people: 
<<switch $users[$userId]["faction"]>>
<<case "Aztecs" >>
 You are the mighty Aztec Empire! You are conquerors of central Mexico, who have claimed vast stretches of territory and stricken fear into the hearts of your enemies--the delicious hearts of your enemies! It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on your shores. Reports indicate that these men do not come from neighboring states that remain to be conquered, but have instead arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. You are curious about these visitors and send a delegation to investigate. What is their purpose here? 
 
<<case "Spaniards">>
You are bold and noble Spaniards! You have set forth into the unknown to claim new lands for the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and new converts to the Catholic faith. It is spring of 1519, and you have made your way up the coast of what appears to be an enormous landmass, into unknown territory. You have unfurled your flag, loudly proclaimed the requerimiento for all to hear, and have succeeded in establishing communication with the natives. And what they have said draws your attention. They tell you of a great city that lies to the west, a city full of gold and countless wonders. You can barely contain your excitement. And yet, there's one small problem: the King has only granted his permission to explore the coast and not to venture inland. You already left Cuba against the orders of the Governor, Diego Velazquez, who revoked his own permission shortly before you left. Will you risk violating the orders of the crown to pursue what may be little more than a rumor?

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
 You are indomitable Tlaxcalan warriors! For generations, you have fought back against the Aztecs and maintained your independence. It is now spring of 1519, and you've received word that a group of strange men have landed on the shores to the east. Reports indicate that these men arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. It is clear that they are no friends of yours, but are they friends of your enemies? When you hear that they plan to advance towards the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, you prepare yourself for battle, as it seems likely they will cross through your territory--a territory you have defended valiantly until now.

Mexica, over the last 200 years, you have vanquished your enemies one by one to become the most powerful city-state in central Mexico.

Many moons ago, during the time of the 4th sun, Quetzalcoatl walked the Earth and ruled over the sacred city of Tollan.

You have been living as a slave among the Chontal Maya for many years now, but you have never forgotten your past life. Born into a noble Nahua family, you were taught many valuable lessons and were respected in your community for your wit and intelligence even at a young age. Among the many things you have acquired in your years as a slave is a facility with the Mayan language, so different from the Nahuatl with which you were raised.<br>
<br>
Today, like every other day, you rose before the sun to begin your chores. As you set to work grinding your corn, however, you find a crack in your metate and set off for the market to purchase a new one. While you were in the market, you overheard a conversation between a local merchant and a trader from Yucatan. Here is what they said:<br>
<br>
<b>Trader:</b><i> Yaan ba'atelil lu'um le witso'obo'. U páajtalil táan u k'éexel yéetel ku beta'al túumben bix u bisikuba'ob.</i><br>
<br>

You will find the heart of Quetzalcoatl in the city of Cholula. You must travel there to claim the heart and secure his blessing. Your journey will be long and difficult, however, and you will need many resources to sustain you if you are to succeed. Collecting these resources is the key to victory. Pochteca, as a trader, you know the terrain well. It is up to you to lead your team in this quest.<br>
<br>d
Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest. They would deny you the blessing of Quetzalcoatl to claim it for themselves, a feat which would surely fuel their warriors and steel them in their struggle against you.<br>

When you have read the following instructions and are ready to begin your quest, click the link below to enter the palace. <br>
<br>
In the palace you will find 6 place glyphs. Each of these glyphs represents a site of great significance in Central Mexico and in each you will find a vital resource for your journey. In order to collect each resource, you must work with your team to identify the correct name that corresponds with the glyph.

:: Act 3, Scene 1: The Great Encounter {"position":"5144,489","size":"100,100"}
<<theyr>>
Causeway leading into Tenochtitlán, November 8th, 1519

The Spaniards' journey is finally done and with their Tlaxcalan companions at their side, they descend upon the city of Tenochtitlán. As the city comes into view, Cortes and his men can barely believe their eyes. Situated in the middle of Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlán is a marvel of engineering, connected to the lake's shores by a series of causeways. As the Spaniards approach, they see an enormous temple rising up from the middle of the city. 
 

An Aztec delegation comes out to meet them. Among them is none other than the Emperor Moctezuma himself. Though he is barefoot, Moctezuma is richly dressed and escorted by his brother, Cuitlahuac, and his Prime Minister, Tlacaelel the Younger. Cortes dismounts his horse and approaches the Emperor to embrace him, sparking horror among the Aztecs, who prevent Cortes from laying hands upon their leader.
 

A ritual then unfolds, with each of the Aztecs bowing to kiss the ground. Each then greets Cortes in turn. When he reaches Moctezuma, Cortes presents the Emperor with a necklace of pearls and glass beads. Moctezuma, in turn, places two necklaces adorned with golden shrimp around the neck of Cortes. 
 

All three factions mingle on the causeway, getting to know each other and formulating their next move. Use this opportunity to get a sense of the opposing side. What do you think they are planning? Who do you trust?

Upon hearing the news, you reflect upon a series of omens that have occurred in recent years. <br>
<br>
First, a fiery comet appeared in the sky and showed itself for a full year.<br>
<br>
Second, a fire consumed the Temple of Huitzilopochtli that could not be put out. When the residents of Tenochtitlán threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger.<br>
<br>
Third, lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining.<br>
<br>
Fourth, a comet fell from the sky in the middle of the day. The comet had three tails and where they were seen, they made a great noise, like the sound of rattles.<br>
<br>
Fifth, the waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.<br>
<br>
Sixth, at night, a woman could  be heard crying out, “O my children, we are about to go forever.” “O my children, where am I to take you?”<br>
<br>
Seventh, the residents of Lake Texcoco caught a strange bird, like a crane. Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror. When Moctezuma peered into the mirror, he saw a group of men marching, outfitted for war and carried on the backs of deer.<br>
<br>
Eighth, strange creatures appeared in the city, creatures with two heads but only one body. When they were taken to Moctezuma, he looked upon them and they disappeared.<br>

Your curiosity about these frightful Mexica is finally satisfied when a delegation arrives at the village. They tell you that they come in the name of the great Emperor, Moctezuma, and each man bows to kiss the earth. After welcoming you to their territory, they present you with a bounty of gifts: mountains of beautiful cotton cloth, plumes of feathers more brilliant and colorful than any you've seen before...and gold. Countless trinkets of gold glisten before you in the sunlight.<br>
<br>

After presenting their gifts, the men deliver a message on behalf of their prince, Moctezuma. Their leader, they claim, “was pleased that such valiant men, as he had heard they were, should come to his country,” for Moctezuma had heard reports of your battle in Tabasco. However, the men assure you that there is no need for a meeting between your two sides. In fact, they tell you the journey to Mexico is treacherous and you would best head back the way you came.<br>
<br>

<<print $Span_Leader>> responds to the men. He tells them that you've traveled many miles to meet their great and powerful prince and you have no fear of the journey that lies ahead.

:: Rumors of Mutiny [Done Breaks] {"position":"582,1744","size":"100,100"}
<<theyr>>
<<print $Span_Leader>>, you have heard rumors and rumblings amongst your faction that they are planning a mutiny. You don't know whether or not this is true, but you are fearful for your life and must not let them rob you of the glory that lies ahead. As you move to the group discussion board on the next screen, you must ensure that the entire faction is ready to follow you inland in pursuit of your dreams.<br>
<br>
You weigh your options and decide that the best course of action is the boldest: retreat cannot be an option! You will beach the ships so that your crew has no choice but to forge onward. Though not destroyed, fixing the ships would require many weeks of repair, assuming they could even find the necessary materials. <br>
<br>
Proceed to the next page, where you will learn [[if there is mutiny|Burning the Ships]]. Your decisions thus far have impacted your scores. Consider where you stand with your men as you decide how to proceed.<br>

You continue along the coast, stopping next at a place called Tabasco. <br>
<br>
As you make your way inland, curious what lies ahead, you hear the sound of drums. You barely have time to process the sound before you realize that you've been surrounded by an entire army of native warriors, their faces painted in black and white, armed bows and arrows, lances, slings, and stones.<br>
<br>
Recalling this event years later, Bernal Diaz wrote: 
“they rushed upon us like mad dogs completely surrounding us, and they let fly such a cloud of arrows, javelins and stones that on the first assault they wounded over seventy of us...I remember that when we fired shots the Indians gave great shouts and whistles and threw dust and rubbish into the air so that we should not see the damage done to them, and they sounded their trumpets and drums and shouted and whistled and cried ‘Alala! Alala!'”<br>
<br>
Your battle with the Tabascans was fierce, but in the end it was the cavalry that secured your victory. Your horsemen arrived late to the battle and overwhelmed the native force. You manage to take five captives and send two of them back to their leader, laden with beads and gifts. Speaking in the strange native tongue, Aguilar instructs them to deliver a message: The native peoples of this land have nothing to fear, for you come in peace. <br>
<br>
You continue inland, [[following behind|Spaniards Meet Marina]] the native messengers.<br>

For weeks now, the Chontal leaders have been hearing rumors that a group of foreigners has been traveling along the coast, making their way towards your village. When word arrived that they had landed upon your shores, the local chiefs sent an army to head them off. Much to everyone's surprise, many of the men came back wounded, telling stories of their defeat. <br>
<br>
They recount the harrowing tale to their leaders, telling of dirty men with pale skin and unkempt hair. The warriors surrounded the strangers and quickly overwhelmed them, firing their arrows and piercing them with spears. They were sure they had killed at least two strangers. They were sure they had secured a victory, only to be shocked by the most terrifying sights. First, there was the loudest noise they had ever heard, so loud it left the men deaf and disoriented. The noise was immediately followed by a giant stone that flew through the air, raining fire down upon them. Second, a team of men descended on them, riding upon the backs of the biggest deer they had ever seen! Wounded and terrified, the warriors fled, but not everyone made it out. Over two hundred men fell dead in the battle.<br>
<br>
Never before have you felt such fear among the Chontal people. As they consider their next move, [[you wonder what these events might mean for you|Marina Tells Her Story]].<br>

It's six weeks into the semester and you're already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute--and it's due tomorrow! The only way you're going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There's no way you'll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it's just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br>
<br>
It's 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you're not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There's no way you'll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they're all taken. It's dead quiet up here, but there's nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You're beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you've never seen before. It's tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br>
<br>
The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it's not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There's not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can't even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can't believe your luck! <br>
<br>
You unload your books and make yourself comfortable--maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it's impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you'll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br>
<br>

<br>
Your heart starts to race. You look around the room.  The library! Your assignment!  You grab your phone from the table next to you, class starts in just an hour! What are you going to do? <br>
<br>
It all comes flooding back.  That dream was weird, so realistic, but you came here to get your history paper done. And now you've lost the whole night!<br>
<br>
You start to gather up your things frantically, praying that somehow you'll find the time to complete the assignment. You knock the pile of books off the little side table next to you, and a neatly stapled stack of paper floats gently to the floor.  <br>
<br>
You grab it, you look, you start reading.  Your history assignment, it is done!  Did you complete it before you fell asleep? You read more. This is good, like really good! You wrote this? You are pretty sure you are getting an A!<br>
<br>
You take a deep breath, you gather your things up calmly. You can't believe it. You don't remember writing this brilliant paper, but here it is, done. And you feel rested, if a bit disoriented.  Everything is going to be alright after all! You text your friends.  You'll meet them in class.<br>
<br>
As you close the door of the weird little room behind you, you know <<link "you'll be back" "return to the library_no door">><<set $Tlaxcalans_currentMap=1000>><<set $Aztecs_currentMap=1000>><<set $Spaniards_currentMap=1000>><</link>>.  You've done your best work here, and that big red chair is so cozy!<br>

You made it through a full day of classes, but it was torture. You couldn't concentrate on anything because all you could think about was that mysterious room and the history assignment you don't remember writing. I mean, you must have written it, right? You feel a little guilty about handing it in, but you decide not to think too hard about that.<br>
<br>
It's now late afternoon and you're finally free for the day. You hurry back to the library, excited to revisit the mystery room and its big comfy chair. You hope that if you look closely, you'll find some clue to what happened...some indication that you really did write that killer paper.<br>
<br>
You arrive on the top floor and round the corner but you can't find the door! You swear this is exactly where you found it before, but it's not here. Confused, you scour every corner of the library to no avail. The door is nowhere to be found. You head home feeling deeply unsettled.<br>

A week has passed and every day you've gone back to the library after class, looking for the mysterious room. You've explored every inch of the building, growing increasingly desperate with every day that goes by. Every night you've lain awake for hours, trying to figure out what happened and whether you just imagined the whole thing. You wonder if you're losing your mind, because it sure feels like it.<br>
<br>
Your history teacher didn't help the situation when she handed back your assignment today. It turns out you really did write it. And you got an A. You now have another assignment due next week and you're extra stressed because now the bar is way too high! Your teacher is going to expect A-level work from you every time and you're just not sure it's in you.<br>
<br>
It's the end of the day and you know you should go home and get to work on this new assignment, but you just can't stop yourself from going back to the library. It's become an obsession. Just like every other day for the last week, you start on the top floor in the back corner. You brace yourself for the worst, knowing that you won't find what you were looking for, but there it is! You can barely believe your eyes. <br>
<br>
You carefully reach for the door knob, afraid that it will disappear before you can grasp it. But it doesn't! You turn the handle, give the door a good pull, and it opens to reveal the room exactly as you remember it: books piled high, overstuffed chair, one small table. How is this even happening? This can't be real...can it?<br>

:: Marina's Choice [Done] {"position":"2227,169","size":"100,100"}
<<theyr>>
You wake to the sound of snoring and open your eyes to find you are back at camp. You feel the hard ground beneath you and look up at the stars. You've never seen a night so clear. The horses rest nearby and the men sleep in the open, scattered around the site. As you lay in the dark, you reflect upon the events that have brought you here and you ponder your situation...Marina's that is.<br>
<br>
So far, you've made smart decisions. Your language skills have made you invaluable to these foreigners and you are already starting to understand their strange tongue. Once you can communicate with them directly, your worth will only increase. Not only have they made it clear how important you are to the team, they have each indicated their...personal appreciation of you...some more aggressively than others. Though their affections are worrisome, and even outright frightening, you wonder if this might work to your advantage. Would it be to your benefit to form a relationship with one of these men? If so, which one? Or are you better off fending for yourself? <br>
<br>
You lie awake for hours, weighing this question carefully. Shortly before the sun rises, you make your choice:<br>

You sent a pair of indigenous messengers out ahead to announce your arrival and declare your good intentions, but they failed to return. Though you would prefer to have assurances that you will be met peacefully, you have no choice but to forge on.<br>
<br>
A day into your journey, you encounter the messengers upon the road, both of them in a state of terror. They tell you that they were imprisoned in Tlaxcala and only managed to escape because the Tlaxcalans were preoccupied preparing for your arrival. The messengers claimed that the Tlaxcalans had threatened them, saying: “Now we are going to kill those whom you call Teules, and eat their flesh, and we will see whether they are as valiant as you announce; and we shall eat your flesh too, you who come here with treasons and lies from that traitor Montezuma!” The messengers tried their best to convince the Tlaxcalans that you share an enemy in Moctezuma, but could not change their minds.<br>
<br>
Alert to the danger ahead, you steel yourselves for battle and thank God for his favor in sending you this news. You send your horsemen out ahead and they are able to thwart an ambush. The battle that follows is fierce and bloody, lasting many days. 45 of your men are killed on the battlefield, but your preparations serve you well and you are able to secure [[a narrow victory|A Spanish Victory]].<br>

After all this time wondering what might come next, you now know that the strange men are headed your way. You begin preparing for war, leaving a crew of men to defend the homefront while the bulk of your forces advance ahead to prepare an ambush. <br>
<br>
The foreigners surround you, however, almost as though they knew what to expect! You've lost the element of surprise and a bloody battle ensues. It lasts many days and you kill many of their men, but their weapons are too much for you and you are overwhelmed by the giant deer that they ride into battle. Despite your best efforts, the foreigners prove to be too much and you are eventually [[forced to retreat|An Unexpected Loss for Tlaxcala]].<br>

After a long stay in Tlaxcala, where you recovered from battle and enjoyed the hospitality of your new allies, you set out for the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlán. Your forces took a hit in the long and hard-fought battle with Tlaxcala, and you now number only 250--only half the number who set sail from Cuba! However, you have succeeded in building a massive army of indigenous allies. You march onward with a force of 10,000 men. <br>
<br>
Before you enter the capital, you have one important stop to make: the city of Cholula, where you will stock up on some much-needed supplies. You have been assured that this stop is necessary, but it might not be easy. Until recently, the people of Cholula were allies of your Tlaxcalan friends, but now the city's leadership is loyal to the Mexica. There is clearly bad blood between the two peoples and you stay on guard as you approach the city.<br>

You leave Tlaxcala headed for the city of Tenochtitlán.<br>
<br>
You must make one stop along the way, however: the city of Cholula. The people of Cholula were your loyal allies for many years, until they betrayed you to become loyal vassals of the Mexica. There is bad blood between you and you long to make the cowardly Cholulans pay for their betrayal.<br>
<br>
As you approach the city, your blood boils, but you remain calm and alert. It's getting dark and your Spanish allies decide to stop for the night, so you set up camp and lie down upon your reed mat to get some rest.<br>

You watch smoke billow overhead as you make your way through the treacherous pass, at the head of any army 10,000 men strong. You will soon reach your destination and lay eyes on the great city of which you have heard so much.<br>

Your journey has been complicated so far, and it makes you think about what lies ahead. How do you feel heading down into the Valley of Mexico? How do you feel about your allies the Tlaxcalans? <br>
<br>
Go to the Spanish discussion board and share your thoughts with your companions. <br>

This army is nothing compared to your own, which is the most powerful force in all of history. Tlaxcala is a tiny city state compared to your massive empire and the foreigners are few in number.

You must spare no expense! These strangers, both Spanish and Tlaxcalan, will enjoy the greatest meal of their life. They will not be able to deny the wealth of the Aztec Empire! If this event is to go down in history as the greatest feast the world has ever seen, there must be a record. You commission a cookbook to commemorate the event. You order your closest advisors to assist you in this task. Each member of your team will create a recipe to include in your cookbook. To demonstrate your culinary greatness, you too will contribute a recipe!<br>

Your first task is to go to your game documents and read Bernal Diaz' account of the Aztec feast. When you are done, go to your site and start a new page titled “Aztec Cookbook.” Here, you must create a recipe using only ingredients that we know were accessible to the Aztecs. You may provide a detailed recipe of a dish described by Diaz or you may use his account as inspiration for a dish or your own creation. Either way, be careful to source local ingredients, because there are points at stake here!<br>

After an eventful evening full of food, pulque and heated debate about your documents, you go back to your quarters and fall into the kind of deep sleep that only comes from over-indulging [[in so many delicious things|Waking up in the Library on a Full Belly]]. <br>

You wake to find yourself back in the library, sprawled across the comfy chair. You missed dinner, but somehow your belly feels strangely full. You swear you can still taste the pulque on your lips, but that can't possibly be true... can it? <br>
<br>
You look at the stack of papers on the floor, and, sure enough, there's your latest history assignment, complete and ready to hand in. Buoyed by the knowledge that another A grade is coming your way, you pack up your things and head home. <br>

After a full day of classes, you head back to the library. You're pretty sure you know how this whole thing works by now and, since your history teacher didn't give you any new assignments, you don't expect to find the door. You round the corner in the library and, as expected, the door isn't there. <br>
<br>
Even though you knew this was going to happen, you can't help but feel disappointed. Tenochtitlán is unlike anything you've ever imagined and you're dying to get back there. You go online and find your history syllabus, wondering when your next assignment is due. Much to your dismay, it's two weeks until you'll get your next assignment. You've never been so eager to get homework in your life! <br>
<br>
You trudge home wondering how you can possibly wait so long. Maybe if you tell your professor you want to get a headstart, she'll give you the assignment early.<br>

<br>
Assignment in hand, you make a beeline for the library. You head for the top floor, round the corner, and there's the door! Eager to get back to Tenochtitlán, you slip inside and flop out in the chair. You close your eyes and [[fall into a deep sleep|Waking up 6 months later]].<br>

The mob has chased your enemies to the palace and have maintained their assault for hours. To everyone's frustration, the Spaniards have effectively barricaded themselves inside, along with <<print $Aztec_Leader>>. <br>
<br>
The assault continues for days, to no avail. There has been no word from <<print $Aztec_Leader>> since the attack and people fear the worst. Finally, a rumor escapes the palace: word has it that the Spaniards have taken <<print $Aztec_Leader>> hostage. You are dismayed at this news and shocked that a leader so powerful could fall victim so easily.<br>
<br>
The assault on the palace proves futile and the city's nobles convince the people to lay down their arms, for now. You must save your energy for the battle that is soon to come. You begin to prepare the city for battle, building new walls, blocking access to canals, and laying traps. You cut off supplies to the palace, hoping to starve out the enemy and punish this king who has failed you so.<br>

It appears that the crowd has lost faith in their leader. Despite his pleas, the crowd below has begun to riot, hurling stones towards the rooftop. You watch <<print $Aztec_Leader>> fall to his knees as he is struck in the head.<br>
<br>
<<print $Aztec_Leader>> is gravely wounded, but alive. Given his inability to calm the crowd below, you wonder if his usefulness has run its course. Go to the Spanish discussion board and contemplate the value of continuing to keep <<print $Aztec_Leader>> as your prisoner. What are the benefits of saving his life? What are the potential costs? You have two choices: keep him alive and in shackles or dispose of him…for good.<br>

Your people have little interest in what you say. It is clear that they have lost faith in you.

You have decided that the benefit of saving <<print $Aztec_Leader>>'s life outweighs the risk. You tend to his wounds and keep a careful watch over the fallen leader. Only time will tell if you have [[made the right choice|Spaniards Plot their Departure]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Aztecs">>
<<if $users[$userId]["role"] is $Aztec_Leader>>
You are gravely wounded, but your captors have saved your life. They treat your wounds and watch over you as you recover. However, you cannot wonder if you would have been better off dead. What dignity have you left? You contemplate your situation and wonder how you ended up in this position. Are you not the most powerful man alive? What could you have done to anger the gods?<br>
<br>
Your people have turned against you and your fate is now in the hands of your Spanish enemies. All you can do now is wait to [[see what happens next|Spaniards Plot their Departure]].<br>
<br>
<<else>>
The riot lasted for many hours, as the residents of the city released months of anger and frustration. An uneasy calm has now settled upon the city, but it is clear this situation cannot continue. The people have lost faith in <<print $Aztec_Leader>>. It is clear that he is no longer capable of leading your people. You gather the council [[for a meeting|Aztec Leader Lives and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot]].<br>
<br>
<</if>>
<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
You've just received another report from Tenochtitlán: <<print $Aztec_Leader>> is wounded! It seems there was a riot among the citizens of Tenochtitlán. The Spaniards sent the captive <<print $Aztec_Leader>> out to calm the crowd but they turned on him! He was struck in the head with a rock. Your spies report that he was still alive when the strangers carried him back into the palace. <br>
<br>

It seems the mighty <<print $Aztec_Leader>> has proven to be just as mortal as everyone else. You wonder [[what will be his fate|Spaniards Plot their Departure]] .<br>

<<case "Spaniards">>
You have decided that the risk of keeping <<print $Aztec_Leader>> alive outweighs the benefit. This injury at the hands of his people has provided you with an excellent opportunity: you can put an end to him and they will never know. You decide to finish him off and send him to meet his Gods. <br>
<br>
You send a messenger to the roof of the palace to inform the residents of Tenochtitlán that their leader is dead, brought down by the hands of his own people! Though you fear another riot, the city remains strangely calm. You worry at the quiet that settles over the city and hope that you will not live to [[regret this decision|Spaniards Plot their Departure]].<br>
<br>
<<case "Aztecs">>
<<if $users[$userId]["role"] is $Aztec_Leader>>
Someone is carrying you back into the palace. Even in your confusion, you can feel the tension in the air. Your captors seem nervous and have been whispering excitedly amongst themselves. <br>
<br>
As you feel the knife in your back, you cry out to your attacker. Do you not deserve a more dignified death than this?! As you slip into darkness, you wonder one last time how your gods [[could have forsaken you so|The End]].<br>
<br>
<<else>>
It is not long before you learn of <<print $Aztec_Leader>>'s fate. After the chaos died down and people retreated back to their homes, a messenger returned to the roof of the palace bearing the worst possible news: <<print $Aztec_Leader>> is dead, toppled by the hand of his own people! <br>
<br>
You yourself watched him fall on the rooftop, but could this really have been his fate? <br>
<br>
The council gathers in haste. [[Decisions must be made|Aztec Leader Dies and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot]]!<br>
<br>
<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
You've just received a shocking report from Tenochtitlán: <<print $Aztec_Leader>> is dead! You can hardly believe the news! It seems there was a riot among the citizens of Tenochtitlán. The Spaniards sent the captive <<print $Aztec_Leader>> out to calm the crowd but they turned on him! He struck in the head with a rock. Your spies report that he was still alive when the strangers carried him back into the palace and no one has seen the body. However, shortly thereafter, the Spaniards sent a messenger out to the roof to inform the residents of the city that their Emperor was dead.<br>
<br>
<<print $Aztec_Leader>> was your enemy, but he was the most powerful man in the world. Will the Gods forgive the Spaniards for this crime? [[Only time will tell|Spaniards Plot their Departure]].<br>

When you learned this, your men gathered wood and built a portable bridge, which you now take with you. <br>
<br>
As quietly as any army that has gone before, you make your way out of the palace through the eerie darkness towards the last remaining causeway. It is all for naught, however! You have been spotted and you watch the lake that surrounds you fill with canoes. Mexica warriors descend upon you from all sides! As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway. Chaos surrounds you as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco.<br>
<br>
Somehow, you make it out alive, but not all are so lucky. You scramble your way to shore and run for your life, desperate to [[escape the carnage that lays behind you|Spaniards Decide Whether to Retreat to Tlaxcala]].<br>
<br>
<</if>>

<<case "Aztecs">>
The whole city flies into action and you watch the chaos that unfolds before you. It seems there have been spies in your midst, for the strangers carry with them a makeshift bridge. Many moons ago, the residents of the city cut off all but one causeway that connects your island city to the shore. This last remaining causeway was itself made unpassable by long broken stretches, but the Spaniards are prepared. You see them lay down their sad little bridge at the first break in the causeway, only to be shot down by the warriors that have flooded into the lake in their canoes.<br>
<br>
As you run into the fray, cutting down your enemies, you watch as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco. Blinded by the chaos of war, you are vaguely aware that some of the Spaniards have made it down the causeway. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them scramble to shore, but you must fight where you are and cannot give chase.<br>
<br>
When the battle is finally done, you survey the scene before you. You wonder how many escaped with their lives. Given the carnage that surrounds you, it cannot have been many. Weary from battle, you thank the gods for your life and [[hope that this tragic chapter is finally done|Spaniards Decide How to Proceed]].<br>
<br>

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
It has been many moons since you left Tenochtitlán, grateful to return to your own lands, your own people. Nonetheless, you have kept close watch on events from afar, aided by an extensive network of spies.<br>
<br>
On this morning, you receive a shocking report. It seems the Spaniards attempted to flee the city... and paid an enormous price. According to your spies, the dead far outnumber the living, who have been spotted in the mountains high above the city. <br>
<br>
You wonder if they will [[eventually make their way back to Tlaxcala|Spaniards Decide How to Proceed]].<br>

As you exit the causeway and the city of Tenochtitlán fades into the distance, you breathe a sigh of relief.

The path before you may not yet be clear or free of danger, but your sense of security has ithemproved considerably.<br>
<br>
It is now time to decide just what that path will be, however. You gather your most trusted counselors to weigh your options.

There is no choice but to lay siege to the city. But will you go it alone or will you return to Tlaxcala and attempt to rebuild your army? If you choose the former, you have no safe place to regroup and will have to launch your attack quickly, relying on the element of surprise to strengthen your hand.

You are not surprised when the Spaniards arrive in Tlaxcala, weary from the events of the past weeks. Your spies alerted you to their presence well in advance. <br>
<br>
You treat your guests to a warm meal and as they settle in, they address the question on everyone's minds: what happened to Cortes? Rather than admit that you abandoned their former leader to his fate, you lie and report that you left Cortes and the rest of the continent as you passed Tlaxcala, taking the opportunity to return home. It seems he never made his way back to Tenochtitlán and that was the last anyone saw of him. It's best for everyone if they don't know you led him into a trap.<br>
<br>
They go on to recount the events that transpired after you left the city. When their story is done, they inform you of their plans: they want to regroup, consolidate their forces over the coming months, and prepare to lay siege to Tenochtitlán. And they want your help. <br>
<br>
The last time Cortes asked you to put your life on the line, you refused. And yet they now ask again. This is different, however. Last time they faced their own enemies and it was not your fight. This time, you have an opportunity to finally defeat the Mexica once and for all. Will you take it?<br>
<br>
Go to the Tlaxcalan discussion board and weigh your options. You have 4 choices:<br>
<br>
<b>Option 1:</b> Aid the Spaniards and lay siege to the Aztec capital. These foreigners have proven themselves to be fierce warriors and they have powerful weapons at their disposal. This may be your best chance to claim victory over your Mexica enemies.<br>
<br>
<b>Option 2:</b> Attack the Spaniards. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted and you have them in your grasp. Now is your chance to do away with the strangers and restore order to your world.<br>
<br>
<b>Option 3:</b> Refuse the request and send the strangers on their way. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted. If you let the two sides continue their fight, they will both come out weaker in the end.<br>
<br>
<b>Option 4:</b> Lie to the Spaniards to trick them into complacency. Though your hatred of the Mexica runs deep, the Spaniards are not to be trusted. If you join forces with your historical enemies, the foreigners won't stand a chance. You will promise support and then send word to the Mexica, laying a trap that the Spaniards cannot possibly escape. <br>

Ten months pass before you are ready to lay siege to Tenochtitlán. Your Tlaxcalan allies use those precious months to win more allies to your cause, taking advantage of family rivalries, in-fighting, and long-standing hatred of the Mexica to expand your army. By turning their neighbors against them, you are able to isolate the Mexica and cut off resources flowing into the capital. Perhaps the greatest move of all, however, was your ingenious plan to build 13 ships that you will carry over the mountains toward the city, along with your cannons.<br>
<br>
When the day comes, you launch your ships and attack from the lake. The island capital is completely cut off and you are able to take the offensive. As you enter the city, you note that the population has diminished. You heard rumors that a plague had torn through the city and it has clearly taken its toll.

The battle against Tlaxcala was long and hard-fought. The Spanish forces have been greatly weakened and now your friends must face the Mexica alone. You heard that the city has been devastated by disease, but will this be enough to assure a Spanish victory?<br>
<br>
You leave Tlaxcala in ruins and start your journey back to Tenochtilán. You have no choice but to return alone. As you near the city, you set up camp for the night, preparing to attack by dark. When all is ready, the Spaniards launch their attack, cutting off the causeways and trapping the Mexica inside the city. Despite being caught off guard, the Mexica mount a powerful defense. The people of the city spent weeks preparing for just such a battle, and they are quick to jump into action.<br>
<br>
The battle is like nothing you could have imagined. The stakes are high and this will be a fight to the death for both sides. The residents of the city-young, old, man, woman-all join the fray, luring the Spaniards into traps and fighting with makeshift weapons. Many others, however, fall victim to the foreigners' superior weapons. The scene descends into mayhem, but it soon becomes clear [[which side will win|Victory Decision Aztecs versus Spaniards 2]].<br>

You are thus heartened when you receive word that the Tlaxcalans have launched an attack on the Spaniards and devastated their forces! Can it be true? Are they really finished? Your optimism is short-lived, however, for the victorious Tlaxcalans are attacking Tenochtitlán! It seems they have been buoyed by their victory and believe they can take control of the mighty Aztec Empire.<br>

The news in Tlaxcala has left your companions bitter and the mood is dark. The Spanish forces must face the Mexica alone. You heard that the city has been devastated by disease, but will this be enough to assure a Spanish victory?<br>

As you near Tenochtitlán, you set up camp for the night, preparing to attack by dark. When all is ready, the Spaniards launch their attack, cutting off the causeways and trapping the Mexica inside the city. Despite being caught off guard, the Mexica mount a powerful defense.

The battle is like nothing you could have imagined. The stakes are high and this will be a fight to the death for both sides.

As the smell of blood and smoke fills your nostrils, you wake with a start. You jolt upright, open your eyes, and let out a scream. You are back in the library, but this time you're not alone. The room is lit with a soft, red glow and looming over you is the most terrifying figure you've ever seen. <br>
<br>
A walking skeleton stands eight feet tall. Feathers sticky with blood cling to his bones and he bears the stench of death. You thought this whole adventure was just a dream, but the god of the Aztec underworld now stands before you. You briefly wonder if you are still dreaming, but when a drop of blood falls on your hand, the feeling is all too real. You know you are awake.<br>
<br>
As Mictlantecuhtli begins to speak, smoke spills from his open mouth. “Human, you have come to my lair uninvited one too many times. Every time I want to nap, I find you in my chair. Robbed of sleep, I have completed all your assignments for you in the hope that you would go away and never come back. And yet, here you are. Again. Have you no gratitude?”<br>
<br>
“And so, I will make you an offer: I will continue to do your work and you will make the Dean's list every semester for the rest of your college career. What you do with that success is up to you. All I ask is for two things in return: first, you must stay out of my chair and second, you must promise me your immortal soul. When you finally reach the end of your life, you will join me in Mictlán. If you refuse me this offer, you must leave immediately and promise never to return. Worst of all, you must do your own damn work. The choice is yours.”<br>
<br>
Well, this explains a lot. You knew you couldn't have written those papers--they were just too good--but you had no idea the price of plagiarism was so high! You think about all the assignments that still await you; graduation is a long way off. Is all that work worth the price of your eternal soul?<br>
<br>
You rise up out of the chair, knees shaking. You know what you must do...<br>

A day after you first hear the conversation above, you are approached by the Mayan lord who has been your master these long years. He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br>
<br>
“Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br>
<br>
You are elated at the message and set out in search of your former companion, Gonzalo Guerrero. Together, you were the sole survivors of the wreck that left you here among the Maya, but unlike you, Guerrero has adopted this new land and forsaken his one true God. Unlike you, Guerrero has not lived out these long years as a slave.<br>
<br>
When you find him, you share the letter. Guerrero reads it and, much to your dismay, he refuses to leave. “Brother Aguilar,” he says to you, “I am married and have three children and the Indians look on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime,--You go and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?”<br>
<br>
You inform Guerrero that God will never forgive him and [[head off to meet your compatriots|Spaniards Quest Instructions 2]].<br>

For weeks now, the Chontal leaders have been hearing rumors that a group of foreigners has been traveling along the coast, making their way towards your village. When word arrived that they had landed upon your shores, the local chiefs sent an army to head them off. Much to everyone's surprise, many of the men came back wounded, telling stories of their defeat.<br>
<br>
The last few days have seen a flurry of activity in the village. The Chontal leaders have been gathering food and jewelry to offer the strangers in a show of peace and friendship. Their greatest offering, however, will be a group of twenty women. These will not be the sisters or the daughters of powerful families, offered in marriage to secure alliances; instead they will be slave women, with whom the foreigners might do what they choose. The master of your house has informed you that you will be included in the offering and you are sent to join the others.<br>
<br>
When you are brought before the foreigners, one of the men performs a ceremony, speaking strange words that you cannot understand and sprinkling water over your head. He points at you while repeating the word “Marina” over and over. You understand that this is [[what they will call you|Spaniards Quest Instructions 2]].<br>

The first occurred early in your journey when you landed upon an island and were approached by the residents, who greeted you with a cry that sounded distinctly like “Castilan, Castilan!” You questioned the local people, who shared a rumor that there were Spaniards living as slaves two days journey inland. You listened to this news with great curiosity, but a storm was coming and you hurried on your way.<br>
<br>
Further along the coast, you did battle with a fierce group of warriors who you came to know as the Chontal Maya. The battle was bloody, but it was decided in the end by your cavalry. The warriors gazed in terror at your horses, clearly overwhelmed and confused at a creature they had never before seen. As part of their peace offering, they presented you with twenty slave women.

<<case "Aguilar">>
It is clear to your compatriots that your language skills are quite valuable, especially with the discovery of the slave woman, Marina. As you make your way up the coast, the Maya language gives way to Nahuatl and thus begins your three-way translation: Marina translates the Nahuatl into Mayan and you, in turn, translate the Mayan into Spanish.<br>
<br>
You reach the end or your journey up the coast, landing at a site that you decide to name Villa Rica de Vera Cruz—[[the Rich Village of the True Cross|Act 1 Scene 1]]. <br>
<br>

<<case "Marina">>
It is clear to your new masters that your language skills are quite valuable, especially with the addition of the strange foreigner who speaks the Mayan tongue. As you make your way up the coast, the Maya language gives way to Nahuatl. Being surrounded by your own mother tongue brings you a strange comfort, but you remain on your guard, engaging in a three-way translation: you translate the Nahuatl into Mayan and Aguilar the priest, in turn, translates the Mayan into the foreigner's tongue: a language they call Castilian, or Spanish.<br>
<br>
You reach the end or your journey up the coast, landing at a site that your companions decide to name Villa Rica de Vera Cruz—[[the Rich Village of the True Cross|Act 1 Scene 1]]. <br>
<br>

<<case "Cortes" or "Alvarado" or "Garrido" or "Olid">>
It is clear that the new members of your expedition possess an invaluable skill: language. As you make your way up the coast, the language that has only begun to sound familiar gives way to something entirely new. Aguilar informs you that you have left Maya territory and are now surrounded by a language called Nahuatl. Thus begins a three-way process of translation: Marina translates the Nahuatl into Mayan and the priest Aguilar, in turn, translates the Mayan into Spanish. <br>
